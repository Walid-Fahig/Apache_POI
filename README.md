Many a time, a software application is required to generate reports in Microsoft Excel file format.
Sometimes, an application is even expected to receive Excel files as input data. For example,
an application developed for the Finance department of a company will be required to generate all their outputs in Excel.

Any Java programmer who wants to produce MS Office files as
output must use a predefined and read-only API to do so.

What is Apache POI?
Apache POI is a popular API that allows programmers to create,
modify, and display MS Office files using Java programs.
It is an open source library developed and distributed by Apache Software Foundation
to design or modify Microsoft Office files using Java program. It contains classes and
methods to decode the user input data or a file into MS Office documents.
